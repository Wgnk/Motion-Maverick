# Motion Maverick 
The project is design to build an obstacle avoidance robotic vehicle using ultrasonic sensors for its movement with Bluetooth connectivity. A microcontroller (ATmega328) is used to achieve the desired operation. A robot is a machine that can perform task automatically or with guidance. The project proposes robotic vehicle that has an intelligence built in it such that it directs itself whenever an obstacle comes in its path. This robotic vehicle is built, using a micro-controller of ATmega 328 family. An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect any obstacle ahead of it and sends a command to the micro- controller. Depending on the input signal received, the micro-controller redirects the robot to move in an alternate direction by actuating the motors which are interfaced to it through a motor driver. Some of the project is built with the IR sensors has its own application so in our project those application is not compactable so we are using ultrasonic sensor .
This project has following features namely :
1) Obstacle avoidance 
2) Bluetooth remote control 
3) Gesture control (bluetooth remote based)
4) Voice commands
